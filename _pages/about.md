Hi, I'm Han Chen. Currently I'm studying at University of California San Diego, majoring in Computer Science. I am open to work right now and working on this website to introduce my experience and my ability.

I know the website still looks quite raw and incomplete, cuz I am still working on it. Thanks to [rjzupkpoii](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io)  I can get such a nice and great website.
